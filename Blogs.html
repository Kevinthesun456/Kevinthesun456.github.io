  <p> Government should have regulations on AI as AI can pose as a serious danger to humans and companies as if AI gets smarter and smarter it may develop emotions and turn on humans thus government should have regulations to prevent this from happening. Since the world is stil fairly knew to AI government should be allowed to overview the developments in AI. This may not happen and AI may not pose that much of a danger but its still best for the government to look over AI. However I can see how with the government controls AI it may not sit right with others.
