  <p> In the stefano bloons tower defense it will be a game similar to the famouse game bloons tower defense but with a twist in that the towers instead of monkeys will be based upon other things that stefano enjoys. These towers will have similar mechanics in upgrading them with 3 pathways to upgrade the the tower just like in bloons tower defense. The "bloons" in this case will be stefano and the objective of the game is to place and upgrade towers to fend off the hoards of stefanos. Each wave will become more and more difficult until you reach the last wave and beat the boss resulting in completion of the game. <p>
