  <br>
  <p> I had considered this project due to the intresting motive behind it. I can see how typing our full website for our digital portfolio is really hard and sometimes is just not as effective. I think that using a card to pull up a digital portfolio is really unique and will really be eaiser for people to pull up other peoples digital portfolios. However I didnt join this project because I felt that this system might have already been implemented somewhere else and I wanted to do something new that I havent done before. <p>

    <br>
  <p>I had originally considered this project due to the interesting motvie behind it which was food. I always thought that getting food was hard at ahs and that if you preorder it then it would make getting food a lot easier and you dont need to worry about long lines and people cutting. I really liked this idea because this problem occured to me alot and I think it will help a lot of people. However in the end I dropped this project because I felt like students might not use this all the time and wouldnt be a very cool project. </p>

  <br>
  <p> I had originally considered this project due to the face that I liked horror games and this type of game in the description sounded very intresting. I love playing games and making them as well and horror games are always fun to mess around with. So when I saw this and how there were these 2 really cool endings I was immidietly hooked. However I stopped and dropped this project because I saw another type of game project that caught my attention even more than this one. </p>

    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/karthik-peravali/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Code Converter</a>
  <br>
  <p>I had considered this project due to the intresting yet complex idea of this. Converting code from one language to another is always annoying and each code although implement the same type of algorithims do it differently with subtle changes to big changes. So a code converter will really help people to get things done if they suddenly realize they need the code in a different language. However I dropped this idea because I think that this project is really complicated and that it may take a long time for this project to be completed. </p>

    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/stefano-giron/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Mouse and Keyboard</a>
  <br>
  <p> This project seems really neat and when I first saw this I was hooked onto the idea. However I quickly dropped this project because I felt that it would be like relying on mandete too much. Also if it doesnt go this route then I think it will just compete with the auto hotkey. I also find this pretty hard to implement too so I ultimately did not join this group. </p>

    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/zoe-yau/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Table Reservation</a>
  <br>
  <p>This one was similar to the one with ordering food online so it caught my eye but I didnt really feel fond of it because I felt that it was a bit too generic. I also felt that people would still rather do phone calls to be more professional. I also dont think all the restruants would allow this in the first place and would only work for restruants that actually allowed this. It might be beneficial to people but not by much in my opinion. </p>

  <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/zachary-allen/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Drums</a>
  <br>
  <p> When I first saw this it caught my eye because it was about an instrument and helping people practice playing the instrument but I dropped it due to the following reasons. I felt that for drums this was already implemented somewhere and that just helping drums may be a bit too specific. I know that its because of the pads and everything but I think that just with a recorder to do the tempo for you practice is good enough already. Also there are games that already do this so I dont know if this would be a good project. </p>

    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/oliver-hankins/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Facial Recongintion</a>
  <br>
  <p>This project caught my eye because it was similar to my project so I was intrested in it. Also wasting time on attendece is a problem and having this issued solved would really help the classroom. However I feel that there are some problems with this. First is that students might abuse this system by using pictures of people to have them be there when they arent actually there. The facial recognition must go off of their recent looks and not their yearbook photos from last year because that may mess it up. All in all cool idea but I think it would be too hard to implement. </p>
  <br>
    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/qasem-abdeljaber/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">VPN</a>
  <br>
  <p>Although I couldnt get to the website I felt that this project would be really useful to students. I know that students always need to use a vpn to hide what they are doing and this would help them but this also brings up the problem. I dont think the school will just let students make a vpn to block them and I just dont think this is a viable idea. If the school lets this then I might consider doing this but for now I dropped this project. </p>

    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/mason-graham/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">IQ games</a>
    <br>
  <p>This project caught my eye as state before becaues I like games and this one was a game project. However I dropped this soon after because it was games to improve someones IQ. I feel that there are already plent of games that do this and this wont stand out unless the games are really adiciting to play. Also making these types of games are draining and alot of the time will be based on a previous IQ game and will just look like an off brand of that game.</p>

  <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/suhraab-alimi/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Tower Defense</a>
  <br>
  <p>I chose this project as the final project that I want to join because first it was a game that seems fun to make and would be pretty addicting to players and would have them playing for hours. Also I think the algorithims in this game would be really intresting to implement and along with the graphics would be really fun to make. Overall I chose this game due to the intresting yet fun aspect of this project.
