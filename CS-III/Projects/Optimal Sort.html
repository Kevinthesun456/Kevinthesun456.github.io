<div class="text">
  <p>  For my data it the bubble sort and insertion sort had around the same times for the reverse order and random text type, but the bubble sort was a lot slower for the ordered file. The bubble sort and insertion sort times were about the same with little differences but my Selection sort had big differences. Selection Sort was the fastest sort for my data and each of the run times were ushually a lot faster than the run times of Insertion Sort and Selection Sort. They were also faster with the reverse order and the random text type order and the ordered file. The ordered text files were usually the fastest because there were no swapping. Reverse ordered was the longest because every single word had to be swapped, and random was longer than ordered but faster than reverse because not every word had to be swapped. In conclusion my selection sort type was the fastest compared to bubble sort and insertion sort.
