  <p>As the world relies more and more on technology the need for secure and privacy on the internet grows. Due to this many websites are switching from http to https .The reason for this is due to the fact that https is more secure than http. The two primary purposes of a secure HTTPS connection is to protect the users data when exchanged between a server and a client, and to prevent eavesdropping between web browser and web servers.So what are HTTPS proxy appliances? They guarantee the internet browser privacy and safety. Private institutions, corporations, schools and other organizations have deployed this new technology to guarantee privacy and security.The risk of getting attacked may not be that big but if attacked it can cause serious damage. An example of this is the MITM attack. A MITM also known as man-in-the-middle attack is a type of cyber attack in which the attacker will secretly intercept and relay messages between two parties who believe they are communicating to each other when they are not. This type of attack allows the attacker to be able to control the entire conversation.</p>
<br> 
<p>There are many risks that go with MITM. They can create chaos and confusion when deliberately messing with the conversations and can result in misunderstandings. They can change the course of the parties actions if they seem fit and can cut off relationships between the two parties.A hash is a complex mathematical algorithm which will carefully process every single bit of what they digest. They will scan the certificate and locate any amount of change in them which will result in a different fingerprint allowing them to point out false certifications.The CA are entities known as Certificate Authorities to which web sites prove their identity in the real physical world using incorporation documentation, Dun and Bradstreet record, their publicly known telephone numbers, and more.Once a website has proved their identity to the CA, the CA will risk their reputation to digitally sign the websites security certificate to prove their identity. By doing this process it proves that the website is secure. When the internet secured connection with the website it must provide the certificate to verify its identity.SSL interception can't be prevented but it can be reliably detected due to the fact that it is impossible to fully change any security certificate.

<p>    When examining an SSL certificate anyone can create a cryptographic hash or digest of the certificates contents. These hashes will carefully process the contents and if even a tiny bit of information is changed an average of half of the fingerprints hash bits will change. This means that the hash can detect any change no matter how small the change is. Any change will result in a completely different fingerprint. The fingerprints were originally based upon the MD5 hashing algorithm but after a while researchers have found that due to special cases it may be exploitable. Due to this the industry had switched over to using a more secure algorithm known as SHA1 A false-positive is the belief that the SSl interception was occurring when it is not and contradictory to that a false negative is the belief that the ssL interception is not occurring when it in fact is. One example of this is the www prefix that when added to the domain name it will give a different fingerprint but it is still the same Certificate.The governments and schools are allowed to eavesdrop on your conversations since they are technically not in your physical property. However we can protect our rights by being aware of our own connections. </p>
