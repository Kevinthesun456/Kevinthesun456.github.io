  <p>Sentient AI will result in the destruction of humanity.The world is always changing and as the ongoing evolution of technology sweeps through the years it fastens the change. Technology brings the world many good things but also may bring downfalls, and as technology increases one technology that many people view differently on is AI or known as Artifical Intelligence. With the increase in AI many people begin to think AI will drastically change the world for the better with the increase in luxary and saftey, however this may not be the case as others begin to think that with the increase in AI technology it will bring the downfall of humanity.</p>
  
  <p> When people think of the advancement of AI in the future they think of the society in which robots do all the work for humans and the humans are able to do nothing and gain the rewards produced by the robots. This expectation comes from the great results done by previous AI technology that greatly helped human society. Common technology such as facial recognition on your phone may come to save you a few seconds to open the phone from using a password but its the technology that is able to recognize the face with a previouse photo and still pinpoint if the person is the same one in the photo. Another popular AI technology is in self driving cars such as Tesla with their technology that indentifies humans to not crash into them. This ultimtly imporves the saftey of humans while giving them luxary. However the most porfound advancement with AI would have to be in the medical field in which physician reasearchers created an AI tool that an effectivly indentify between 2 life threatning heart conditions. With the ability to distinguish the heart conditions doctors are able to give the correct diagnosis to patients and not risk giving them the wrong diagnosis for it to be discovered years later. While all these examples of AI are just mere tools to help humans, many people belive that with more advancments in AI they will be able to perform human tasks that distinguish between a human and a robot. However can AI really understand the human brain or act like a human?
  </p>

  <p>
    AI can never always be 100% accurate at what they do and with the increase in wanting AI to perform even harder tasks than playing a simple board game like GO to beat humans they can screw up and with the higher level of task the AI is required to do it may sometimes lead to harm on humanity. With this reaserchers have sent out global warnings to warn the advancments in AI and later with the pace of AI development it will bring the downfall of humanity. AI may never be able to truly understand human emotions since human emotions is such a complex thing which is the sole component that differentiates us between animals. Human emotions is such a complex thing where all humans emotions are different and to have AI copy that would be very challenging. What would most likely happen with AI is the need to do something without thinking of consequences. AI will take the most efficient path in doing something and will do whatever it takes to complete the task disregarding emotions. Even with human emotions how can a robot differentiate between whos human emotions are right. A depressed human walking around trying to hurt people justifys his cause with anger and hatred due to depression while the people hurt by the person is letting out fear and anxiety. How would the AI know what to do in this situation if AI's purpose is to help humanity. How can the Ai determine which human to help?

  <p> Even if AI is able to become sentient and understand human emtions the world still wont be able to become the perfect society people hope for. If AI ever reaches this level of advancement then it would be much more efficient for humans to use AI to run the world than humans. If Ai were to become sentient then they should not take on bad emotions such as greed and jealousy. AI with these emotions are able to make descisions accordinly to their own will and for their own happiness if they have that emotion. At a certain level of sentience AI will have a goal and that goal is not what humans want but rather what the AI wants because just like humans with emotions, all humans true motiviation to do something is if it is important to them. AI wouldnt care for all of humanity and just things that they care about which will lead to the downfall of humanity. So yes as AI sentience may help the world in some way it will eventually lead to the extinction of humanity as no race sees eacher other as equals.</p>
