      <p>For last years ISP My team and I created a "wordle" like game but instead of the concept of guessing a word, the player had to guess an equation to match a number.For example if the number has 5 and there was 3 spaces, the user would need to create an equation without the "=" to have it equal 5 so something like 2+3 might work. The game was also similar to wordle in the sense that if you got the number right or operator right but not in the correct spot it would highlight yellow, if it was in the right spot it would highlight green and if not in the right spot and wrong number/operator it would highlige red.</p>

      <p>Up above is part of the code that uses a for loop and while statements along with if statements to make the program generate a good equation. What that means is the program will generate an equation that wont be too hard or too simple. They will also maket the generated equations more intresting as it will try to have less duplicate operations or numbers. The numbers also generaly tend to be in the single digits to avoid difficulty. The answer also had to be a whole number so when the divide operator is throwin in the equation it has to be an easy whole number that pops out and not a decimal.</p>

      <p>The motivation behind this is mainly due to the fact of the advancing popular game Wordle that everyone was obssesd about. However this was with english and we wanted to do something that would intrest us nerds like math. Hoping that if we make our game similar to wordle it would be fun to play in our spare time. Although there was other games that already did something like this we wanted ours to be more simple and easy to play. This project was mainly to make a game to play that would help students relax.
