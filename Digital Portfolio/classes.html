  <p> The courses that I took this year are Computer Science 3, AP BC Calculus, AP Chemistry, AP Gov and AP Macro, AP Physics C, and AP Lit. In my previouse computer science classes I had learned many languages but the main language that I learned was Swift. I learned most of swift in comp sci 1 such as the basics and learned more languages in comp sci 2 such as html, css, and java script. In those classes I used shell to write my code and do projects which I would push to github. In my comp sci class we learn a lot of information from codermerlin but also online resources to help guide us in our comp sci journey.  </p>
