      <p> &emsp; &emsp; This portfolio is important to me because it shows off my dedication to computer science and will show off my achievments in computer science so far. It is important so that I can document my experiences so I can prepare for the future to show off to potential employers and companies that I wish to work for. It is a log to my journey in computer science of what I have accomplished and what I have learnt. Some of the things that will be in this porfolio will include past projects, essays, and information about me. I hope that this portfolio will give the viewer a better understanding of me and will help them evaluate me and my computer science skills better. Ultimately this portfolio will show off my best work and give me a sense of pride in my work.</p>
